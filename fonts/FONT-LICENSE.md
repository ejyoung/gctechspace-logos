# Font licenses

The typefaces used for this logo (MicroFLF, MicroFLF Extended) were found on the internet and did not come with a license. There are many fonts that have either been abandoned by their authors or the authors distribute their fonts without an explicit license.

It is our opinion that if the unlicensed font is freely available for download from either the original source or from multiple free-font sites then we assume it to be safe to use the font commercially. This is no guarantee of such freedom, but there are so many unlicensed free fonts distributed by primary sources that the intentions must be read that the font is free to use how you like.

Note: The content of this file is based on [the entry for this font on FontSquirrel.com](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/MicroFLF), one of the many places this font is available for free online.
