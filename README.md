- Half version

## Contributing

If the GCTechspace logos are modified in the future, the files youâ€™ll want to make changes to are the Adobe Illustrator files in the `ai` directory. These are what have been used to export the other versions of the file, so if you propose any changes to the logo, make sure your pull request also includes exported versions in the various formats too.
